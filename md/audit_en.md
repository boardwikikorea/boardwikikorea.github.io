# Event Regulations and Judging Criteria

# Category-Specific Rules and Judging Criteria

## Freestyle

> While rankings are part of competitions, true skateboarding is about style. The competition format requires objective scoring based on overall performance, but this does not define the essence of boarding.

- Scores are based only on tricks performed within the allotted time. Practice level or progression is not considered.
- Preliminary rounds are generally done in pairs, but solo runs are allowed. Finals are always solo runs.
- Standard run time is 2 minutes for both prelims and finals. This may be adjusted based on the number of participants.
- In the Master and Newbie divisions, only one run will be held without a preliminary round.
- Repeating the same trick or dancing line during the 2-minute run will only count once.
- Approximately 10 participants advance to the finals (subject to change based on event circumstances).

### Judging Criteria

> Only final round scores will be announced. Judging is based on **difficulty**, **variety**, **flow**, and **style**. Score distribution is as follows:

| Category  | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Dancing   | 30 pts | Evaluates variety and difficulty |
| Tricks    | 30 pts | Evaluates variety and difficulty |
| Flow      | 30 pts | Measures consistency and smooth transitions. <br/>Failed tricks are deducted unless recovered swiftly. <br/>Emphasis on fluid, well-composed overall performance. |
| Style     | 15 pts | Focus on individuality, creativity, and originality.<br/>Signature moves, unique combos, or personal expression are rated highly. |

#### Scoring Details

**Difficulty**
- Only successfully landed tricks are evaluated.
- Trick speed, clean landings, and complexity of combos are all considered.

**Variety**
- A well-rounded run includes multiple trick categories:
  - Dancing steps (basic steps, chop-style, fakie, pirouettes, etc.)
  - Rolling tricks (shuvit, no-comply, slides, etc.)
  - Flip tricks (handflip, kickflip, etc.)
  - Stationary tricks (nose spins, truck stands, casper, etc.)
  - Manual tricks (nose/tail manuals, etc.)
- Runs showcasing multiple categories are rated higher than those focusing only on one or two.

## Best Trick
* Two opportunities will be given. However, if there is an issue with the landing during a round, a video review will provide one additional chance for reattempting. (No additional reattempt opportunities are available)<br/>
* Variables such as the toes touching the ground due to flexing will be judged by the judges through video review.<br/>
* If both feet land on the ground instead of the deck, the attempt will be considered a failure.<br/>
* If all participants fail, one additional opportunity will be given, and if there is still no successful attempt, no winner will be selected.<br/>
* Participants must submit their intended tricks in advance on the application form (tricks can be the same or different for the two rounds).

## Best Dancing
* Two chances will be given to complete a line from start to finish.<br/>
* If both feet touch the ground, or if a push-off is used to simply increase speed during the line, it will be considered a failure.<br/>
* Tricks such as Ghostride, Piglet, and Lookback, where one step touches the ground, are allowed.<br/>
* The evaluation will be based on speed, carving, step difficulty, and flow.

## Best G-Turn

> G-Turn (where the two wheels of one truck are not touching the ground) event<br/>

* G-Turns will be evaluated based on the variety of tricks and speed (number of wheels), with the score being calculated into one final score.<br/>
* Extra points will be awarded for mixing various G-Turn tricks such as Heel Turn, Toe Turn, One-Foot, Two-Foot, and Seated.<br/>
* The G-Turn will be considered a failure if either wheel of the non-grounded truck touches the ground at any point.
* G-Turn and Out-Trick events will be discontinued starting in 2025.<br/>

* "Challenge Opportunities" may be held on-site, with 1-2 chances depending on time availability.

## Event Categories

### Hippie Jump
* Two chances will be given at the same height.<br/>
* If the bar being jumped over falls, it will be considered a failure.<br/>
* If there are two or more successful participants, the height will be increased, and the process will continue until only one participant remains.

### Best Hand Trick (Test)
* The number of foot plants does not matter (it will be reflected in the judging criteria).
* Two chances will be given with no reattempt opportunities.

### Best Pair (Test)
* Pairs can be mixed genders or any combination of participants.
* A 2-minute run will be given, and participants are free to showcase any tricks.
