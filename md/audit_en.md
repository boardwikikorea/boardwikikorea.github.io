# Event Regulations and Judging Criteria

## Freestyle

* The preliminaries are held with two participants, and the finals are held with one participant.<br/>
  Added March 2025 > It is possible that the preliminaries will also be held with a single participant.
* Each participant is given 2 minutes for both the preliminaries and finals. (The time may vary depending on the number of participants.)
  Added March 2025 > In the Master and Newbie categories, only one run will be held without preliminaries.
* Duplicate tricks within the 2 minutes will not be counted towards the score.<br/>
* Approximately 10 finalists will be selected, with adjustments made based on circumstances.<br/>
* Only the final scores will be announced, with the distribution of points as follows: Dancing (30), Trick (30), Flow (30), and Style (15).

### Evaluation Criteria

> The evaluation will consider difficulty, variety, flow, and additionally style.
* Difficulty (speed of the tricks, landings, and the connection between tricks)<br/>
* Variety (variety of tricks such as dancing steps, spin tricks, flip tricks, manual tricks, slides, etc.)<br/>
* Flow (consistency without failure, connection between tricks)<br/>
* Style (originality, signature tricks)

## Best Trick
* Two opportunities will be given. However, if there is an issue with the landing during a round, a video review will provide one additional chance for reattempting. (No additional reattempt opportunities are available)<br/>
* Variables such as the toes touching the ground due to flexing will be judged by the judges through video review.<br/>
* If both feet land on the ground instead of the deck, the attempt will be considered a failure.<br/>
* If all participants fail, one additional opportunity will be given, and if there is still no successful attempt, no winner will be selected.<br/>
* Participants must submit their intended tricks in advance on the application form (tricks can be the same or different for the two rounds).

## Best Dancing
* Two chances will be given to complete a line from start to finish.<br/>
* If both feet touch the ground, or if a push-off is used to simply increase speed during the line, it will be considered a failure.<br/>
* Tricks such as Ghostride, Piglet, and Lookback, where one step touches the ground, are allowed.<br/>
* The evaluation will be based on speed, carving, step difficulty, and flow.

## Best G-Turn

> G-Turn (where the two wheels of one truck are not touching the ground) event<br/>

* G-Turns will be evaluated based on the variety of tricks and speed (number of wheels), with the score being calculated into one final score.<br/>
* Extra points will be awarded for mixing various G-Turn tricks such as Heel Turn, Toe Turn, One-Foot, Two-Foot, and Seated.<br/>
* The G-Turn will be considered a failure if either wheel of the non-grounded truck touches the ground at any point.
* G-Turn and Out-Trick events will be discontinued starting in 2025.<br/>

* "Challenge Opportunities" may be held on-site, with 1-2 chances depending on time availability.

## Event Categories

### Hippie Jump
